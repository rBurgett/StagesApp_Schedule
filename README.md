# StagesApp

StagesApp is a mobile application in four parts. There is the mobile application itself, the desktop application, the collaboration server, and the cloud server. Development to version 1.0 is scheduled to take three years from start to version 1.0.

# StagesApp Collaboration Suite

## 1) StagesApp Mobile Application

This is the primary tool for culture and language acquisition, analysis, and review. It is a mobile application built to run on any phone or tablet running Android or iOS with a screen of 4.7" or larger. This includes Android derivatives like inexpensive Kindle Fire tablets.

## 2) StagesApp Desktop Application

This is a desktop application which will run on any desktop or laptop computer with Windows, macOS, or Linux (Ubuntu). The mobile device will register with this device and sync data directly to it in order to free up limited phone memory. It will also provide expanded tools for those who want to use keyboard and mouse for audio, transcription, and review work *(note: this same functionality will be available in the mobile application as well but that will be optimized for touch controls rather than control via peripherals like a keyboard and mouse)*.

## 3) Collaboration Server

This is a hardware device which will plug into the local network of any team using StagesApp and will automatically back up and sync data from the application. This will provide a central storage place for the entire project, allow sharing of data among the team, provide collaboration tools, and generate reports for CLA consultants. This server will also communicate with the Cloud Server (if an internet connection is available) to back up the entire project off-site.

## 4) Cloud Server

This is the central hub for the backing up of all projects from all teams and for sending reports and displaying progress data for consultants.
